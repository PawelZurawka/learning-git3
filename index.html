                Say your prayers little one 
                Don't forget, my son
                To include everyone
        
                Tuck you in, warm within
                Keep you free from sin
                Till the sandman he comes
        
                Sleep with one eye open
                Gripping your pillow tight
        
                Exit light
                Enter night
                Take my hand
                Off to never never land
            </p>

                Something's wrong, shut the light
                Heavy thoughts tonight
                And they aren't of snow white

                Dreams of war, dreams of liars
                Dreams of dragon's fire
                And of things that will bite

                Sleep with one eye open
                Gripping your pillow tight

                Exit light
                Enter night
                Take my hand
                Off to never never land

                Now I lay me down to sleep
                (Now I lay me down to sleep)
                Pray the Lord my soul to keep
                (Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
                If I die before I wake
                (If I die before I wake)
                Pray the Lord my soul to take
                (Pray the Lord my soul to take)

                Hush little baby, don't say a word
                And never mind that noise you heard
                It's just the beast under your bed
                In your closet, in your head
        
                Exit light
                Enter night
                Grain of sand
        
                Exit light
                Enter night
                Take my hand
                We're off to never never land
        
                (BUM! Yeah, yeah)
        
                (Off to never never land
                Take my hand
                Off to never never land
                Take my hand
                Off to never never land
                Off to never never land
                Off to never never land
